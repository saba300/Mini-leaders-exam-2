        <h1>Programming</h1>
        <p>
            I was interested in programming since 4th grade. When I was in 5th grade I started learning it in Mziuri.
            I was learning programming in Mziuri for 3 years. At fisrt year I was studying Pascal. At second and third year I was studying c++,
            But I didn't liked their studying methods at third year so I quit and continue learning at Komarovi.
            But when I was studying programming at komarovi there was only 3 or 4 students at lessons and lessons were so boring,
            which made me little lazy and I quit. Then I started learning at GOA and I really like it.
